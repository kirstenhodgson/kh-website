I am a graduate student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, UC Santa Barbara, completing my Master of Environmental Science and Management with a specialization in Conservation Planning and a focus in Strategic Environmental Communications. I enjoy reading, baking (anything chocolate!), trying out new data viz techniques, and hanging out around trees.
