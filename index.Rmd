 I am a first-year Master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara, completing my Master of Environmental Science and Management with a specialization in Conservation Planning. I am also pursuing a focus in Strategic Environmental Communications. When not studying, I enjoy reading, baking (anything chocolate!), and hanging out around trees.
